Architecture getting out of hand - notion of data behind view didn’t really happen until Backbone.

Risk and dev time associated with any changes increases with number of lines of code

It’s easy to feel like the only way to make things better is to start over.

1. You’re guaranteed to screw up.
2. Sustaining development alongside a rewrite is expensive too
3. You’re probably inexperienced with whatever new technology you choose for this.

### Guardrails
- ESLint
- Testing
- There's a right way to do this, we can verify that it works
- This is a thing that you can do well and a thing that you can do right.
- Git hooks, ant tasks, standardization around the frontend

### Every technology decision is eventually regrettable.

Doing web development is an exercise in empathy both for the user and for the person working on the thing before you. The decisions we make today aren’t going to stand the test of time any better.

Framework or no, JS growth is unbounded in the absence of constraints.

Education is a powerful enabler of improvement.

Building for the web is better today.
